It guides users through structured Focus Sessions with real-time feedback on remaining time, upcoming tasks, and time saved by staying on track. 
Timers and sessions persist in the background for uninterrupted focus. Users receive timely alerts as tasks approach, reach, or exceed their time limits. 
The app also supports Live Activities, allowing users to monitor their sessions directly from the Lock Screen or Dynamic Island without opening the app.`,
